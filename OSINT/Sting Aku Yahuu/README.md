The name of shops behind him can be seen clearly:

1. Modmal Kitchen & Nenny’s
2. Warong Poksu Moksu Serambi

You can search any of the shops. If you search “**Warong Poksu Moksu Serambi**”, you can find their Facebook page stated that their 3rd branch is located at Bazar Serambi Teruntum. That’s our flag.
