# **Sunny Day**

## Description

While on a recent trip, my friend sent me a photo capturing a beautiful, sunny coastal view. Something about it seems familiar, though—like a scene from a popular drama this year. Maybe I’m recalling that moment when a car "accidently" drowned into the ocean…

Can you identify the beach name and the drama name? The flag is case insensitive.

## Solution

You were given a `png` file that you need to investigate. Looks like a picture of a beach taken from the road.

To know the location of the image, you can use Google Lens to check for any similar image that can give some hints.

From Google Lens, there are two potential locations:

1. **Dodu-dong Rainbow Coastal Road, Jeju Island**
2. **Ayajin Beach, Goseong-gun**

### **Dodu-dong Rainbow Coastal Road, Jeju Island**

Yes, the location has a colored barrier along the coast but as you can see, the location is quite rocky. So, this is not the location.

### **Ayajin Beach, Goseong-gun**

A Naver blog, [Goseong Ayajin Beach Gangwon-do Winter Sea Trip : Naver Blog](https://m.blog.naver.com/msjh1012/222989913488) shows the colored barriers along the beach. This one is more accurate as you can see the sandy beach and also reflective mirror.

Now, we need to find which drama was shot in this location. Some hints of the drama can be extracted from the description: 

1. From a popular drama this year. (2024)
2. Has a scene where a car "accidentally" drowned in the ocean

If you search “**ayajin beach drama**”, there will be 2 possibilities:

2. Lovely Runner ([루루 & 보위 | Ayajin Beach is featured in ‘Lovely Runner’ captures sea and nature perfectly. Ayajin Beach in Goseong is a perfect choice for a relaxing... | Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ru_in_seoul/reel/C9z2JhFSyMJ/))

### It’s Okay Not to Be Okay

We can assume this is not the drama because it released in 2020, not 2024. Also, there is no scene of car drowned into the ocean in this drama.

### Lovely Runner

This drama seems like the correct answer, it was released in 2024. And, it’s also quite famous among K-Drama lovers.

Now, we need to check if there is really a scene car drowned into the ocean.  Hmm, looks promising.

JACKPOT!!

A car owned by one of the characters, Kim Tae Sung was drowned into the ocean. (the car’s name is Sunny, hence the challenge title)
