# **Oops! My History Leaked!**

## Description

Uh-oh! Looks like our dear challenge author accidentally leaked his own Chrome browsing history...and, well, itâ€™s interesting, to say the least. He swears he was just doing "research," but we're not so sure.

The flag was scattered in three parts.

## Solution

You can open SQLite database file using DB Viewer like this [SQLite Viewer Web App](https://sqliteviewer.app/). 

The flag is in base64 and will be hidden inside the URL in three parts. Sort by title to see all the URLs.

Use Cyberchef to decode the base64 string.
