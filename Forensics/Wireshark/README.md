# **Wireshark**

## Description

First time seeing a network capture file? Don't worry, there's nothing much in there other than the flag. You just need to know how to open the file.

## Solution

You need to install a packet analyzer software, like Wireshark to open `.pcap` file. 

In Wireshark, right-click any TCP packet, select **Follow > TCP Stream** to view the conversation.

Hereâ€™s the flag.

Also, you can check each of the packets since there are only 15 packets. But please learn how to filter in Wireshark so you don't need to check each packet. 

*P/S: Trust me, I had seen more than 10,000 packets for a CTF challenge, and it is a nightmare if you want to check it individually ðŸ’€.*
